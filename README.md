# jtbin-releases

Unoffical Github releases of cores from [jotego/jtbin](https://github.com/jotego/jtbin).

## What is this?

In the [releases](https://github.com/davewongillies/jtbin-releases/releases)
section of this repository are dated Github releases of all the binary versions of
Jotego's cores for the MiSTer FPGA and Analogue Pocket from his [jtbin](https://github.com/jotego/jtbin)
repository.

## Why?

Jotego releases cores as binary files (`.rbf`, `.zip`, etc) in his jtbin repository.
If for some reason you want to find an older version of a core, it involves
going back in the git commit history, which is a pain.

## How?

Go to releases on the right hand side of this page, then find the date of the cores
that you're looking for. Releases are date formatted `YYYY-MM-DD`

* Pocket cores: `.zip` files
* MiSTer FPGA cores: `.rbf` files

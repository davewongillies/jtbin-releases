Unoffical releases of cores from jotego/jtbin

## What is this?

In the [releases](https://github.com/davewongillies/jtbin-releases/releases)
section of this repository are dated releases of all the binary versions of
Jotego's cores for the MiSTer FPGA and Analogue Pocket from his [jtbin](https://github.com/jotego/jtbin)
repository.

## Why?

Jotego releases his cores as binary files (`.rbf`, `.zip`) in the jtbin repository.
If for some reason you want to find an older version of a core, it involves
going back in the git commit history, which is a pain.
